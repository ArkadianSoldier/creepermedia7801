- 👋 Hi, I’m @creepermedia7801 and welcome to my personal repository.

- 💻 I am an a avid tech enthusiast and love learning more about a variety of fields from 🎮 game development to 🔐 cyber security. I've been coding for a very long time now and 
  know how to code in languages like Python, Java and C# to name a few. I also enjoy using the Unity game engine to create small games and expand my knowledge on a variety 
  of algorithms, most recently being the A* pathfinding algorithm.

- 💞️ I’m looking to develop my skills and improve projects via contributing to the open source community which is something I have always wanted to do but didn't know where
  to start.
